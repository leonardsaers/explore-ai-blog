# Help me create a 3d fish using Freecad

While there are other tools, ChatGPT defines a baseline for publicly available generative AI. In this exploration, ChatGPT was asked to create a fish using [Freecad](https://www.freecad.org/).

This is the final result:

## The conversation

> [me] - Hi, I would like to have some help creating a figure in Freecad using the part design work bench and the sketcher work bench.

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - Certainly! FreeCAD is a powerful open-source parametric 3D CAD modeler that enables you to create various designs using different workbenches. Creating a figure involving both the Part Design and Sketcher workbenches is a common workflow for many designs.

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - Could you provide more specific details about the figure you want to create in FreeCAD? For instance, are you looking to create a simple 2D sketch that you'll later extrude or revolve in the Part Design workbench? Or are you looking for guidance on a more complex figure?

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - Regardless, the typical process involves these steps:

``` textbaseline
Sketcher Workbench:
    Create a 2D sketch of the figure using lines, arcs, circles, rectangles, etc., within the Sketcher workbench.
    Apply constraints and dimensions to define the shape and size of the figure.

Part Design Workbench:
    Pad or revolve the sketch to create a 3D object. Use the Pad tool to extrude the sketch into a 3D solid, or the Revolve tool to create a solid by revolving the sketch around an axis.

Could you provide more details about the figure you'd like to create or any specific questions you have about using these workbenches in FreeCAD? This will help in providing more precise guidance.

> [me] - I would like to create a sketch of a fish and then pad that sketch.

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - Creating a sketch of a fish in FreeCAD involves using the Sketcher workbench to draw the fish shape and then the Part Design workbench to pad (extrude) the sketch to turn it into a 3D object. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

``` text
Creating a Fish Sketch:

    Open FreeCAD and create a new document.

    Switch to the Sketcher Workbench:
        Click on the 'Sketcher' workbench in the workbench selector or navigate through the menu to access the Sketcher workbench.

    Create a New Sketch:
        Click on the XY plane in the 'Model' tab to create a new sketch on that plane.

    Sketch the Fish:
        Use the various sketching tools like lines, arcs, and splines to draw the outline of a fish. For example, you might create an oval for the body, triangles for the tail and fins, and arcs for the mouth and eye.

    Apply Constraints and Dimensions:
        Use constraints (horizontal, vertical, coincident, etc.) and dimensions to define the shape and size of the fish.

    Exit Sketch Mode:
        Once you've completed the fish sketch, exit the sketcher.

Pad the Sketch:

    Switch to the Part Design Workbench:
        Click on the 'Part Design' workbench.

    Select the Sketch:
        In the model tree view, select the sketch you've just created.

    Use the Pad Tool:
        Click on the 'Pad' tool from the toolbar.
        Define the length or depth of the extrusion. You can drag the arrow or input the exact value.

    Adjust Parameters:
        Set the parameters such as length, type of operation (if it's a solid or a pocket), etc.

    Confirm and Finish:
        Click 'OK' or 'OK and Close' to confirm the pad operation.

View and Modify:

Once you've completed the pad operation, you should have a 3D model of a fish. You can then:

    Rotate, pan, or zoom to view the 3D fish model.
    Go back to the Sketcher to modify the initial sketch if needed.

Remember to save your progress regularly as you work in FreeCAD.

> [me] - Thanks for the instructions. Could you create the code that creates that fish and then pad it?

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - Certainly! Below is an example Python code to create a fish sketch and pad it in FreeCAD:

``` python
import FreeCAD as App
import Part
import Draft

# Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Create a sketch on the XY plane
sketch = doc.addObject('Sketcher::SketchObject', 'FishSketch')
doc.recompute()

# Add points to define the fish shape
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(20, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(20, 0, 0), App.Vector(20, 10, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(20, 10, 0), App.Vector(15, 5, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(15, 5, 0), App.Vector(20, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(20, 0, 0), App.Vector(20, -10, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(20, -10, 0), App.Vector(15, -5, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(15, -5, 0), App.Vector(20, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Line(App.Vector(20, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Arc(App.Vector(5, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(5, 5, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.Arc(App.Vector(5, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(5, -5, 0)))

# Add constraints to define the fish shape
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint('Coincident', 0, 1, -1, 1))
sketch.addConstraint(Sketcher.Constraint('Coincident', 1, 2, -1, 1))
# Add more constraints to define the shape and size of the fish...

# Pad the sketch to create a 3D object
pad = doc.addObject('PartDesign::Pad', 'FishPad')
pad.Profile = sketch
pad.Length = 10  # Define the length of the extrusion

doc.recompute()

# Save the document
App.getDocument('Unnamed').saveAs('path/to/save/FishModel.FCStd')
```

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - This code creates a fish-shaped sketch and pads it to generate a 3D object in FreeCAD. You might need to adjust the coordinates and constraints in the sketch and pad parameters to match the fish shape you desire. Additionally, replace 'path/to/save/FishModel.FCStd' with the desired path and filename to save the FreeCAD document.

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - This script can be executed in the FreeCAD Python console or saved as a .py file and run from the FreeCAD Python interpreter.

> [me] - I get the error "TypeError: Unsupported geometry type: Part::GeomLine".  Maybe you could use Part.LineSegment instead or use Part.BSplineCurve if you would like to make a more advanced looking fish. 

> [ChatGPT-3.5] - Apologies for the confusion earlier. Certainly, let's use Part.LineSegment to define the fish shape within the sketch. Below is the revised code to create a fish-shaped sketch using Part.LineSegment and pad it in FreeCAD:

``` python
import FreeCAD as App
import Part
import Draft
import Sketcher

# Create a new document
doc = App.newDocument()

# Create a sketch on the XY plane
sketch = doc.addObject('Sketcher::SketchObject', 'FishSketch')
doc.recompute()

# Add points to define the fish shape using Part.LineSegment
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(0, 0, 0), App.Vector(20, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(20, 0, 0), App.Vector(20, 10, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(20, 10, 0), App.Vector(15, 5, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(15, 5, 0), App.Vector(20, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(20, 0, 0), App.Vector(20, -10, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(20, -10, 0), App.Vector(15, -5, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(15, -5, 0), App.Vector(20, 0, 0)))
sketch.addGeometry(Part.LineSegment(App.Vector(20, 0, 0), App.Vector(0, 0, 0)))

# Pad the sketch to create a 3D object
pad = doc.addObject('PartDesign::Pad', 'FishPad')
pad.Profile = sketch
pad.Length = 10  # Define the length of the extrusion

doc.recompute()

# Save the document
App.getDocument('Unnamed').saveAs('path/to/save/FishModel.FCStd')
```

You can modify the coordinates of the line segments to adjust the shape and size of the fish as needed. Also, replace 'path/to/save/FishModel.FCStd' with your desired path and filename to save the FreeCAD document.
